Hello! How are you?

This project is a basic LP, with changes made upon the challenge of the ballerini community

I sought to bring harmony between the spaces and also in the animation, since I inserted keyframes that made the issue of starting access to the site smoother. In addition, I added a touch of hover to the menu, thus bringing a sense of movement and dynamic interactivity when navigating through it.
