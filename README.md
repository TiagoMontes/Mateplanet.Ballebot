Hello! How are you?

This project is a basic LP, with changes made upon the challenge of the ballerini community

I was inspired by many sites with smooth animation and great uses of Grids, in order to have a spacing organization.

I put animations in sequences with delay, so we don't have a feeling that all the items appear at the same time, but that each one has its specific time to come to the screen.

Finally, I would like to thank Rafaella Ballerini for teaching flexbox and helping to build the LP
